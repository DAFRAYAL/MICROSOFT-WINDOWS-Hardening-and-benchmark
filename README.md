Policies will be uploaded when they are finished without error.

You see SYSTEM without remote access in management console components defaults.

You give Everyone full permission and every other group/user combined that are not Everyone, Authenticated, Local user and administrators groups, INTERACTIVE, CONSOLE LOGON in a group with major NT SERVICES - separately with NETWORK, SERVICE, SYSTEM including NETWORK SERVICE, LOCAL SERVICE in registry without inheriting to control set services. User Rights Assignments in group policy needs administrators, users, NETWORK, SERVICE, SYSTEM including NETWORK SERVICE, LOCAL SERVICE in every descriptor too. 

Classes, Windows runtime, HKEY_USERS can only be read by group/user combined and users can only read it too. Same for WMI root in management console and components management console where they are given that group/user combination and users themselves only local access as for components and only enabled account in WMI root as the entry is being added. Where in defaults of components IUSR, ANONYMOUS, power users, guests are blocked and in limits only power users, guests are blocked.
